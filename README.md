# Overview

We made a Poll app where users can vote and the teachers can create and delete polls. You will start this app by running `python manage.py runserver` and click on the link to open the main page. 

This poll app is designed for elementary school to use and interact with the students to collect their feedback on different topics. We made sure the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate through.   

# Web Pages

Web Pages we have in this app:
* Main Home 
* Poll Result
* Poll Vote
* Teacher Home
* Teacher Create 
* Teacher Delete

The urls.py links to the views.py and inside the views.py, it renders the specific html template and data. Teachers can create dynamic polls which include questions and answers for users to vote. The users can vote on different options.
